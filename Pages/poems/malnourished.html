            I am addicted.<br>
            I am a feen for the drug of your attention.<br>
            A drop that is your love.<br>
            Strike down from above the bits that you leave for me.<br>
            It's not enough.<br>
            Now for a new chapter I write,<br>
            All the laughter in my sight.<br>
            I know nothing but pain.<br>
            The happiness is an llusion that guides me from myself to a calm place to be.<br>
            I think about you...<br>
            Every night of every day,<br>
            the times before I lay,<br>
            the words I speak before you are my beliefs.<br>
            Yet you ignore them.<br>
            They aren't taken in.<br>
            To you they're obsolete but to me it's what I eat.<br>
            I feed off the words you say to me.<br>
            Yet unlike a street drug this shouldn't cost money.<br>
            The love you give should be unconditionally for free.<br>
            I shouldn't have to ask or beg.<br>
            Things always get so complicated.<br>
            Words so powerful you should stop thinking about how it sounds to you, but how it sounds to me.<br>
            Drifting through the night my thoughts.<br>
            They line up into straight lines to be fired as a bullet from the gun used in combat.<br>
            My thoughts are a fight.<br>
            One so violent every hospital in a radius is in code black.<br>
            The comeback is the bed I lay.<br>
            A "Good Nights Rest" is only as good as the night.<br>
            So if you ask me how my sleep was and I say bad understand that this isn't sleep.<br>
            The word sleep has symbolic meaning behind it.<br>
            When someone says "I am going to sleep" it sounds peaceful.<br>
            So I didn't sleep.<br>
            I was knocked unconscious due to the severity of my wounds in a fight I didn't win.<br>
            Yet I still arise the next or same day with hours in the past and infinity in the future I wait.<br>
            Just cause I can now see the battlefield doesn't mean I can win.<br>
            It tease the inevitability of my lost.<br>
            Yet when I still hear that addiction can be cured I laugh.<br>
            Since every ounce of my Fentanyl called hope will always feel like a screen I use my laughter as my totem.<br>
            And only when the punchline is no longer painful will I know I've waken up.<br>
