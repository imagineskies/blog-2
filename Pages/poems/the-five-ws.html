  <meta name="description" content="This is one of my newest poems that I've written. It follows me asking myself the five w's. Who, What, When, Where and Why. The constant theme is me questioning who is to blame for my abuse as a child. As well as me expressing the anger I hold towards my parents. I do love them dearly, but there are things I have yet to forgive them over.">

            Who did this to me? I go days at a time trying to think of who is to
             blame. Is it my fault for not knowing better? I'm so ashamed that I
              let it go on for this long. I blame my parents for not doing
              enough to prevent a preventable hell. Should their ignorance
              expell them from any wrong doing? Should I blame my abusers for
              their depravities of teaching a minor that sex sells or do I
              blame myself for falling victim? They recked hell making it look
              heavenly, and me a devoted christan trying to get there. I took
              comfort in my missory as it made more memories than my happiness.
              So now pain is where I find peace, I betray myself as a release,
              thriving for that dopamine rush I got my first time being called
              sexy. Who should I blame for this rhapsody of self hatred?
          </p>
          <p>
            What could have possibly been more important than my innocence? You
            tried to protected me from the outside but it only made me more
            curious. Instead of teaching me I was left vulnerable to leaches
            that tainted my ability to trust. I developed lust at such a young
            age because you failed to gauge my alone time. So now I'm left with
            open wounds that bled a blind eye for the world to see.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was younger my sanity was split between you two. <br>
            My pain, you carried. <br>
            My problems, you solved. <br>
            Yet my vanity resolves to nothing now. <br>
            The only thing that is clear is how split you two really were. <br>
            My suffering as a child a by product. <br>
            You left me in the wild by myself surrounded by wolves and lions to
            rip apart my tender flesh. <br>
            Forcing a soft child to grow rough keloids for tough skin. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Where you dropped me cost my dignity.
            I learned that abuse is love and love is abuse.
            Now I'm too scared to love that I let myself be used, and amuse
            those who demand. I am not the little kid I used to be. Through
            evolution my environment broke me. So now, growing up as an adult is
            only teaching me how much of myself I don't know. How much I was
            told to know.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why was it easy for you to turn the other way instead of finding a
            remedy? I was forgotten in the dust of my old happiness while one of
             you was off making more. The other I watched do chores just so I
             could get what I need. The nights I slept wished to bleed were
             lonely and timid. I basked in the night on the days I didn't want
             to be awake and had fever dreams in class instead of doing work.
             The times I showed signs of my troubles they were ignored only to
             teach me not to expect help. I went into debt expecting a wealth of
             love and it only taught me how not to. So now how dare you pester
             me with my lack of calls and cares. I struggle to walk up the
             stairs of forgiveness and I never know how to let go and take the
             first step. So don't expect me to forget what I wish I could. <br>
             When you could have helped, you didn't. By the time you did, I was
             already too prudent to accept it.
