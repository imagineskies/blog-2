  <meta name="description" content="This is one of my newest poems that I've written. It follows me asking myself the five w's. Who, What, When, Where and Why. The constant theme is me questioning who is to blame for my abuse as a child. As well as me expressing the anger I hold towards my parents. I do love them dearly, but there are things I have yet to forgive them over.">

          <p>
            I’ve always been fascinated by violence. What causes someone to be this way?
            What could be the rhyme or reasons to change someone's seasons letting
            someone's once warm body grow cold? I think about death a lot. Having to
            cope with my own at 13, I have never been the same. For me, I look past
            the questions of an afterlife as the concept of one is antithetical to 
            its own existence. I don’t care about living after I’m dead, I would rather 
            live before I die. Except there is a difference between living and surviving 
            as very few people are left thriving. Most people want something better. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve always been fascinated by being violent, specifically murder. How can you 
            take a life? At which point could destruction become synonymous with human nature? 
            When did we lose our empathy? At what point did we conflate revenge for justice? I 
            wish we lived in happier times. I have more questions than I will every have answers 
            four more mass shootings for us to ignore. I’m sure I remember babies washing on shore. 
            I’m sure war will never do anything else but justify more, at what point is “enough” 
            enough? By the type we care to see we will all be blind. By the time humans learned peace 
            we will have destroyed all the places to be peaceful. Were we never peaceful? Was there 
            never a time when we didn’t lay down single fire lines of ammunition to get a point across.
          </p>
          <p>
            Domestic and International <br>
            Rationally Irrational <br>
            Fearing what we refuse to understand is something I never understood, like it 
            isn’t for me to. The people who sign out declarations of war are the farthest 
            from living in its consequences. Slaughtering a country’s child for crimes they 
            didn’t commit. Imagine being beaten and condemned when you don’t submit. What 
            does it say to the world when BDSM subculture has more compassion than state 
            senators? We will whitewash the darkness until there is no longer a reason to 
            be delicate. I would rather be celibate than bring a child into this. That 
            saddens me. That we the people have choses superiority over Unity, and I hate the 
            games we play. Culture wars and wedge issues built from hyping up nonissues as we 
            all get in line to vote for the worst of two evils. People who crave power deserve 
            it the least and current events do nothing but prove that.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mind is tired. It doesn’t matter who cast the first stone because the way that 
            I see it, we all live in glass houses. Wolfs in sheep's clothing. At some point in 
            time, we are all sinners. There are no gods or kings, only man, and the humans that 
            pretend to be gods are the furthest from one. I hate the system we live in. Being nothing 
            but a wage slave is not what I imagine adulthood to mean. What I mean is that I will work 
            while my body breaks, crumbles into a chasm so that my bones and flesh become fuel for 
            the future generation to start conflict over. This isn’t the movie that I paid to see 
            but we will never be refunded for the cruelty. If anything, we will only pay more for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hate my fascination for violence, it has never brought me peace. I wish I could remain 
            ignorant like a child thinking death is like a video game or pausing a movie. I don’t know 
            if you could tell by now, but I’m angry. As every day goes by, we lose our concept of time. 
            Once second turns to hours, hours turn to days, by the time we blink again it will be December but
            somehow, I don’t trust the news cycle to remember. Just another tragedy to forget while we 
            cast catastrophe silhouettes. Let's “Never Forget” that we always will. Atrophy has set in. <br> 
            I’ve never wanted my fascination for violence...<br>
            ...but it seems my fascination has wanted me.<br>
